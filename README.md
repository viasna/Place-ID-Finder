# Place-ID-Finder
A Place ID Finder is a specialized utility used to retrieve the unique, permanent identifier assigned by Google to millions of locations worldwide. While coordinates (latitude and longitude) identify a physical point on a map, a Place ID (e.g., ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4) identifies a specific entity, such as a business, park, or landmark.
